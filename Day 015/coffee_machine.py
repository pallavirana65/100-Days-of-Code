# Day 15 Project - The Coffee Machine
# This project allows the user to choose a drink (espresso, latte, or cappuccino).
# The code checks if there are enough ingredients for the drink. If there are enough ingredients, the user enters money.
# Finally, the code calculates and gives the user back change and their drink.
# Secret inputs: If the user enters "report" instead of a drink name, it will print the amount of each ingredient left
# in the coffee machine. If the user enters "off", then the coffee machine will turn off.
