# Day 6 Project - Reeborg's World - Maze Challenge
# Reeborg the Robot is stuck in a dark maze with no flashlight. The code has Reeborg following the wall on his right side to navigate through the maze to the exit, no matter what position he starts in.
# Reeborg knows a limited number of commands (such as only turning left or moving forward) and conditions. This project required defining new functions (i.e. 'turn_right()) for Reeborg to follow.
